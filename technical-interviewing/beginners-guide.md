# The beginners guide to giving a Qbiz Technical Interview


## Overview

This document is meant to help ensure some standardization in how we conduct technical interviews for Qbiz.


## The Qbiz Interview Process

1. Resumes are sourced
2. Initial screen of candidate by a recruiter
3. HackerRank quiz
4. **Initial Technical Screen**
5. "Final" Interviews

This document is going to focus on the Initial Technical Screen.

## Structure of the Interview

* Brief introductions (~5 min)
    * Give a brief intro of yourself first, it will set the expectations of what you're asking the candidate to do.
* {Optional} Review the Hacker Rank results with the candidate (~5 min)
* Python evaluation (~15-20 min)
* SQL evaluation (~20-25 min)
* Provide the candidate an opportunity to ask you questions (~5-10 min)
    * They have to want to come to Qbiz if we make them an offer
* Wrap up (~5 min)
    * This should be the same whether you think you will recommend the candidate or not.
    * "The next step is for you to provide your feedback on this interview to Emily (or other recruiter) and they will be in touch about next steps"
    * "Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today"


## Things you should do before the Interview

* Review the candidates resume
    * Look at their background, see how much experience they have
* Review the hacker rank quiz responses
    * You should be able to get a sense of their coding style and may find some areas that you'll want to probe during the interview
* Set up a CodingView Interview and name it appropriately
    * Recommended: {Candidate Name} {Date} i.e. "John Doe 2022-02-09"
* Select the questions you want to ask for both python and SQL
    * Pick out 2-3 python questions, and 2-3 SQL questions, you'll only have an hour for the interview, but you'll want to have some extras in case they fly through the easier questions.
    * See [question-bank](/technical-interviewing/question-bank)


## Things you should do after the interview

* Hit the "End Interview" button in CodingView
    * You can end it during the wrap up of the interview, but if you don't make sure to do it once the interview is over
* Fill out the feedback form in FreshTeams
    * As much as possible write some context around the ratings, giving someone three stars on a section doesn't convey much information, but giving them three stars and saying "Candidate struggled with window functions, but did well with the complicated joins" 

## Things to keep in mind
* It's OK to be nervous about giving an interview, but keep in mind the candidate is nervous too
* Our goal is to assess the candidate's skills, not to torture or trick the candidate with "gotcha" questions
