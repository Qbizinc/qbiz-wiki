1. Select the `Language` you want to work in
1. Select a `Question` from the Question Chooser
1. `Copy` the question text to your clipboard
1. Go to the left pane of the Interview screen, type <kbd>Cmd-A</kbd> followed by <kbd>Cmd-V </kbd> to replace all the text of the working pane with the question text
1. Let the candidate write some code
1. Hit `Run` to see the results of their code
1. Repeat 6,7 as needed until you are satisfied with their answer
1. Repeat 2 if you are switching languages
1. Repeate 3-8 as needed until the interview is over

Three things to note:
* The `Interviews` "tab" where you can get to the list of interviews
* The `Questions` "tab" where you can go to author or edit questions
* The `Create Interview` button which is the one thing you'll need when setting up an interview.

## The Interview Page

* The `Interview Name` textbox where you can (and should) customize the name of the interview session.
* The `Language Selection` drop down, allowing you to set what language you are testing
* The `End Interview` button, which you should not press until you are done, but once you are done, you absolutely should press.
#### Middle
* The left pane is where you type code
* The right pane shows the results of running the typed in code
  * You can also type in commands on the command line, but it isn't usually necessary
#### Bottom
* The `Participants` list, there should be a dot for you, and one for the candidate.
* The `Invite` button allows you to get a link to share with the candidate
* The `Run` button, which will allow you to run the code in the left pane.

Things to note:
