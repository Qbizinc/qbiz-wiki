# 2023 Qbiz Referral Program

Who is the best data professional you know? Refer them today and help us grow!  The purpose of the Qbiz Referral Bonus Program is to get quality referrals that Qbiz can fast-track through the hiring process - besides the obvious benefit of working with people you know and love. Referral programs are proven to improve company culture, employee retention, and shorten hiring processes. 

Referral Bonus Program: Qualified US team members are eligible to earn up to $4,000, and qualified MX team members are eligible to earn up to $1,500 for referring a consulting candidate that joins the team as a full-time employee!

Referral Bonus Fine print: 
- In order to qualify, referrals must be submitted via Freshteam (see below for further instructions).
- The first half of the Referral Bonus is earned and paid in the pay cycle after which the referred candidate joins the company. 
- The second half of the Referral Bonus is earned and paid out in the pay cycle after which the referred candidate marks their 6 month anniversary with the company. 
- People managers, recruiters and HR personnel are not eligible for the Referral Bonus.
- Employees who resign prior to or are not employed for any reason for the full pay cycle during which a Referral Bonus is earned are not eligible for the payment of bonuses, even for candidate referrals submitted prior to termination.
- This program is applicable for referrals submitted between February 22 , 2023 through June 30, 2023 and bonus earnings and/or eligibility may be modified on a case by case basis any time at the sole discretion of the CEO. This program does not, in any way, commit the Company pay similar types of bonus compensation in any subsequent periods. 

Who is a good referral? A good candidate for referral is someone you know, have worked with or went to school with, and has good technical and consulting skills. they must be willing to travel occasionally in the future and feel comfortable working/taking meetings in Pacific Standard Time hours (although potentially not always as we get more clients elsewhere.) We’re happy to hear recommendations or names of other potential candidates as they will help us grow, but if they aren’t someone you know, they aren’t eligible for the referral bonus.

Can’t think of anyone you might want to refer? Close your eyes, visualize and then connect on LinkedIn with:
- Old college friends you used to copy homework from and (almost) forgot about?
- Gifted colleagues you jockeyed to work with at previous jobs?
- Really smart client-side employees at previous consulting/contracting clients?
- Consultants from other companies whose work commanded your respect on previous engagements?

FreshTeam directions for submitting a referral:
- Get your referral’s resume and LinkedIn URL.

- In the "Why do you think this candidate is a good fit for the role?" section of the FreshTeam form, paste their linkedin URL and make sure to address each of these statements:
- I have talked to this person about Qbiz and they are interested
- I know their technical qualifications! And in my opinion, they are qualified (make not of those qualifications)
- I know their soft skills and believe they would do well in a client-facing, consultative role
- I have worked with this person and I can vouch that they are highly qualified and a great co-worker 

Save and done!
