<h3>Qbiz Technical Interview Thoughts </h3>


2022-02-01

<h3>Overview</h3>


There is a desire to have a more standardized process for technical interviews at Qbiz, this document is my attempt to capture my thoughts for this process with the expectation that others will contribute after the first draft.  

Apparently based on history, this seems to be a (roughly) yearly exercise at Qbiz where we examine our technical interview processes and make adjustments.

<h4>Background</h4>




* Document from 2021 (last year): 
* Document from 2021 (last year): 
* Document from 2020:  (Pre-pandemic)
* Document from 2019: (Pre-pandemic)

<h4>Changes Since 2021</h4>




* New hacker rank test with 10 questions, no multiple choice
    * Very difficult to complete in given time
* Switch from Coderpad.io to CodingView.io
    * Coding view is a little bit clunkier but is cheaper

<h4>Things We Want from the Process</h4>




* We want the process to be fair to candidates
* We want candidates to have a similar experience regardless of who actually conducts the interview (consistency)
* We want the process to be able to include more people as interviewers
* We want the interviewers to be able to be themselves during the interview, not reading from a script.
* We want the interviewers to have some flexibility in terms of what questions they ask, in terms of quantity, and depth

<h4>Things We Look For From Candidates</h4>




* Clear communication skills
* Technical proficiency with SQL 
* Technical proficiency with Python or a comparable programming language
* Ability to understand nebulous requirements
    * What questions do they ask if the instructions aren't clear?
* Ability to adapt to changing requirements
* Ability to think in (data)sets vs procedurally
* Ability to collaborate

<h4>Available Questions</h4>

<h3>Proposed Future Standardized Process</h3>


Two types of technical screens, two classifications of interviewers.

<h5>"Minimum Technical Competency" for all candidates Level 3+</h5>


The purpose of this test is to make it more scripted, easier to administer the interview, clearer guidelines on what's expected from the interviewer.  This will allow us to widen the funnel and get more people through.  This type of interview should be limited to 1 hour.



* Low complexity python 1-3 questions (a la palindromes)
    * We will have a predefined set of questions with our answers provided (to the interviewer).
    * Focus on set manipulation, lists, loops, data structures/classes
    * Maybe 5-7 questions available to choose from 
* Straight-forward SQL series of questions (a la vordo)
    * Again these will be scoped questions, with our answers provided (to the interviewer)
    * Should cover Different types of joins, aggregations, CTEs (maybe), Window functions (maybe)
* These interviews would be able to be given by all interviewers, but we should skew towards the less senior interviewers.

<h5>"Advanced Collaboration" for Senior candidates, high level 4, level 5+</h5>


The purpose of this type of interview is to allow our current senior interviewers (Gustavo, Jay, Rob, Soren) to really dig in and vet the more senior candidates, the people we expect to come in and really influence the Qbiz culture.



* This interview would focus on one larger/more complex problem where the interviewer has more freedom to pair program with the candidate and figure out if they would be a good fit culturally, how they problem solve, how they communicate in a technical sense.
* Much less structured than the MTC interview
* Not all candidates would go through this, only "high value" candidates where we want the extra scrutiny.

<h3>Current Individual Processes</h3>


<h4>Rob's Process</h4>


This is just a run through of what I do before and during the interview, my hope is to get a couple of other people to document their approaches so that we can find the commonalities.



* Before the interview
    * 
    * Read through the resume
        * Make notes about important points that I want to follow up on during the interview
    * Read through the Hacker rank answers
        * Look for general coding style, how questions were answered, where the candidate was right, where the candidate went off track
* Interview itself
    * Explain the agenda for the interview
    * Introduce myself, quick elevator pitch style
    * Ask Candidate for similar intro
    * General questions about background
        * This is usually improvisational and I try to follow up on the items the candidate seems most interested in talking about
    * Go over the hacker rank results
        * Not in great detail, but I ask them how they thought they did, if they struggled with anything, etc.  
        * Most people indicate that they ran out of time, I tell them that was intentional on our part as we provide less than the recommended amount of time because we want to see how they manage their time.
        * If there are questions where they seem to have struggled, I will go over the general approach for the question, what we were looking for, etc.  I don't bring up the document, I just talk about it in general ways because it gives me a sense of how much they recall. 
    * Switch to CodingView.io
        * As a general rule, I enable the execution of code in the tool because I want them to try things and see how they might debug things, what they focus on, etc.
        * Palindromes
            * Relatively simple, the question provided has some gaps in terms of method definition taking a string, while the sample inputs provided are a list.
            * "Palindromes are not a big part of our business, don't worry about getting it "right", this question is to help me understand how you think through a problem."
            * If they breeze through, maybe even getting the optimal [::-1], then start making it harder, in terms of mixed case, punctuation, spaces, etc.
            * If they struggle, try to understand why - is it a loop problem, is it string manipulation, etc.  see how they react to clarifications or suggestions on where they might be off track.  In addition, if they make mistakes I ask them how they might debug it, looking to see what they choose to print out
        * Merging Intervals
            * This question is a little more complex, it's also intentionally vaguely written.  I expect people to ask for clarification, but I usually lead with "take a look, try it, let me know if you have any questions".
        * I try to keep the Python questions to under a half hour, even if the candidate struggles with them.  Transitioning to the SQL question(s) is easy for me because I can indicate that the SQL skills are more important to what we do than the Python skills.
        * Vordo PostgreSQL
            * This actually contains a bunch of questions building up from some simple selects into a more complicated set of join conditions across three tables.
            * There are some "traps" in here as there is no consistency in naming between the different tables, and there are no keys defined (and one table has a duplicate "primary key")
            * Again, I let them work through the questions, but I know some of  the traps and so I'll ask leading questions when they get results that I know are wrong.
        * Election Followup 
            * On the old hacker rank quiz, we had a question about some made up election data. I recreated that question in CoderPad and then would show the candidate their own code for that question and ask them to analyze it.  I then asked a much simpler follow up question to see if they were aware enough to recognize the simpler requirements and didn't get wrapped up trying to modify the code I gave them.
            * Most of the candidates who did well recognized their own code.
    * Provide opportunity for candidate to ask questions
        * "Recruiting is a two way process, we need to decide on making you an offer, but you need to decide if you want to join Qbiz.  So now, it's your turn, ask me whatever you want to know about, what information do you need to make your decision."

<h4>Jay's Process</h4>


Rob captured these notes in conversation with Jay about how he goes about doing the technical interviews.  



* Data Scientist vs Data Engineer
    * Don't have time to do both Python and SQL, pick one based on hacker rank/resume/preference
    * DS can be too panda centric, may have forgotten basic SQL
    * Gravitate towards SQL question
    * Pick the weaker from HackerRank
* Interview process
    * Journey in Data, how did you become passionate in data
    * What interests them in consulting
    * switch to codingview
        * Work solidly on the one problem up until 10 minutes to end
        * want to be collaborative, prompting if they're quiet about their thought process
        * provide hints if they're stuck
        * provide guidance if they go down the wrong path
    * Last 10 minutes their questions
        * Selling if it's a really good candidate
        * General information if it didn't go well, maybe suggestions of things for further study
* Bottom line: Do I enjoy interacting with this person 

<h4>Gustavo's Process</h4>




* Identify skill level 
* Compare Emily's level vs resume/LI
* Calibrate towards perceived level
* Willingness to learn new technologies
* Why consulting?
* Interview
    * Short intro
    * small Overview of the process
    * Feel pressed for time with interview time cut down to 1h
    * Sometimes (20%) Hacker Rank review for level 5, not for 3/4
    * Jump right into CodingView
    * Feeler questions at the start to gauge level
        * Joins, low level transpositions
    * Start with SQL, pivot to python in the last 20 minutes
    * SQL:
        * Evaluate code visually, won't run the code
        * Joins, transpositions, specific types of SQL, moving averages, bucketing, ranges, fuzzy matching
        * Sessionization - only for level 4.5/5
    * Python
        * Code can be run, encourages prototyping

<h4>Soren's Process</h4>
