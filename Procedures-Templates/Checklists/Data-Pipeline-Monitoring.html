<p>Checklist for monitoring a data pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Ensure that all the required services, such as Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, BigQuery, and any other services used in the pipeline, are properly configured and running.</p>
<p>2. Monitor the pipeline's logs to ensure that all the stages of the pipeline are running as expected. You can use Cloud Logging to collect and view logs from all the services in the pipeline.</p>
<p>3. Set up alerts for critical pipeline events such as pipeline failures, data loss, and data quality issues. You can use Cloud Monitoring to set up alerts and notifications for various metrics and logs.</p>
<p>4. Monitor the pipeline's performance to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues. You can use Cloud Monitoring to monitor various performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and data throughput.</p>
<p>5. Ensure that the pipeline is processing data within the expected time frame. You can use Cloud Monitoring to monitor the latency of data processing and set up alerts for any performance issues.</p>
<p>6. Monitor the data quality and integrity to ensure that the data being processed is accurate and consistent. You can use Cloud Data Loss Prevention to scan data for sensitive information, Cloud Data Fusion to validate the data, and Cloud Dataflow to monitor data quality.</p>
<p>7. Monitor the pipeline's cost to ensure that it is within the expected budget. You can use Cloud Billing to monitor and manage your billing and set up alerts for any unexpected costs.</p>
<p>8. Regularly review and update the pipeline's monitoring and alerting configurations to ensure that they remain relevant and effective.</p>
<p>9. Conduct regular testing and validation of the pipeline to ensure that it is functioning correctly and meeting the required performance and data quality standards. &nbsp;</p>
