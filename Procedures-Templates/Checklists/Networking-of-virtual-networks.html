<p>Checklist for networking virtual networks in GCP:</p>
<p>1. Define your network topology: Determine how you want to connect your virtual networks, and what kind of traffic you want to allow between them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create your virtual networks: Use the GCP console or command-line interface to create your virtual networks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Configure network peering: If you want to connect two or more virtual networks, you'll need to configure network peering. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Set up firewall rules: Use GCP's firewall rules to control incoming and outgoing traffic to your virtual networks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Configure VPN or interconnect: If you need to connect your virtual networks to on-premises networks or other cloud providers, you can use VPN or interconnect. &nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Monitor network traffic: Use GCP's monitoring tools to keep an eye on network traffic and troubleshoot any issues that arise. &nbsp;</p>
