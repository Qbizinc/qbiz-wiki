<p>This checklist helps you set up Google Cloud for scalable, production-ready, enterprise workloads. It is designed for administrators who are trusted with complete control over the company's Google Cloud resources.</p>
<p>The checklist includes 10 tasks that have step-by-step procedures. Some tasks can be accomplished multiple ways; we describe the most common path. If you need to deviate from the recommended path, keep track of your choices because they may be important later in the checklist.</p>
