<p>Checklist for managing billing and costs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP):</p>
<p>1. Create a budget: Set up a budget for your GCP project to track your costs and alert you when you exceed your allocated budget.</p>
<p>2. Review your usage and costs: Use GCP's billing reports to track your usage and costs across various services and projects.</p>
<p>3. Optimize your resources: Use GCP's cost optimization tools, such as rightsizing, reservations, and recommendations, to optimize your resource usage and reduce costs.</p>
<p>4. Set up alerts: Configure alerts to notify you when costs exceed a certain threshold, so you can take action to control your spending.</p>
<p>5. Use cost allocation: Use GCP's cost allocation feature to allocate costs to different departments or teams, making it easier to track expenses.</p>
<p>6. Monitor your billing data: Use GCP's billing data export to export your billing data and monitor your usage and costs in real-time.</p>
<p>7. Review your billing statements: Review your billing statements regularly to ensure that you're being charged correctly and to identify any unexpected charges.</p>
<p>8. Manage access and permissions: Limit access to your GCP billing account to authorized personnel only, and review your IAM policies regularly to ensure that access is appropriate.</p>
<p>9. Use third-party tools: Consider using third-party tools, such as cloud cost management tools, to manage your GCP costs and optimize your spending.</p>
