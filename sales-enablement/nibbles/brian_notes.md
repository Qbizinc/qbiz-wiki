# Likes
- Data science projects
  - career growth
- Variety as well
  - don't mind DE if mixed in
- At Adobe, siloed from other data scientists
  - Tom (manager/director, recently promoted?)
  - Syed reports to Tom

# Growth Opportunities
- project scoping upfront
  - understanding what data would have been needed
  - enough stakeholder commitment and allocation of their resources?
    - high enough signoff from all stakeholders
    - someone to actually push through delivery to the end?
