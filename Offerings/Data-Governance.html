<p>Getting access to Alation University is now a self-service capability.Have each user perform these steps:Register for an account on the Alation Help Center using your existing work email - <a href="http://help.alation.com/">help.alation.com</a><br>From the Alation Help Center, click the Alation University tile.<br>Once in Alation University, you will be able to access all courses and see your progress from “My Training Progress”.After registration, it may take a few hours to fully sync your account to the new experience. If you run into any issues, please email <a href="mailto:alation.university@alation.com">alation.university@alation.com</a>.As far as "certifications" - the users will see the "Brilliance Badges" which represent the key courses that they should take, as well as a course called "Alation Certified Consultant Path" as well as the "Alation Professional Seller" path.Once a Brilliance badge course has been completed, the user can then display the brilliance badge on their LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>I found the following two brilliance badges to be a good overview of Alation functionality and general concepts relevant to our current talk track around (Agile / Non-Invasive / Active) Data Governance.</p>
<p>Data Analyst Advocate 44min</p>
<p>Alation Data Governance Advocate 2hr</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Certified Alation Developer path is much more in-depth and Alation tool specific (good if you are going on a project where Alation is currently being used) 10hr</p>
