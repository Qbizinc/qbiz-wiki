<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The purpose of this methodology is to provide tips and tricks crowd-sourced from Qbiz’ very best consultants, that should help put you on the path to success for any type of client project</p>
<h2>Before interviewing with a client</h2>
<p>Depending on how fast we move with a client, you might not have the time to cycle through these steps prior to meeting w/ the client. Do the best you can with the time allotted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if you feel that there is a mismatch between your skills and what will be required for a project - could you potentially ramp up on gaps within a few days? If so, talk to your client director. We may be able to move a screen by a few days to buy you some time to <strong>prepare correctly</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>411 on the client<ul>
      <li>Go to their website / install their App</li>
      <li>How do they make money? Search for 10-k financial statements if applicable</li>
      <li>Latest mentions in the news (key acquisitions, new products)</li>
      <li>Who are their competitors?</li>
      <li>Mission statement?</li>
      <li>Ongoing priorities / initiatives?</li>
      <li>Areas of growth? How saturated is their total addressable market?</li>
      <li>Who do I know there?</li>
      <li>Who are the key players you’ll interact with?</li>
      <li>What's the client's tech stack?<ul>
          <li>If cannot find on the web, ask the sales team / your manager for these details</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get a clear understanding of the project<ul>
      <li>Talk to your manager / sales director / client team member for the details</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Over-prepare for the tech-screen<ul>
      <li>Use our question bank in our Google drive</li>
      <li>Talk to your colleagues for some tips and tricks - especially those who have worked with the client</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>When interviewing with a client</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Be honest and transparent about your experience and exposure<ul>
      <li>For example, if you know nothing about docker and you know that this will come up prior to the interview<ul>
          <li>Don’t: Zero experience with docker</li>
          <li>Do: Spend some time prior to the interview (even if its the morning of) looking at high-level literature on Docker, and identify some courses to sign up on.</li>
          <li>Ping some colleagues to set up a brain dump. During the interview, say that you’ve started to ramp up on Docker, and that you’re hoping to have considerable exposure on it by the proj start date.</li>
          <li>If any questions come up on Docker, punt on them and tell the interviewer that you’ll get back to them in a few days with the answer, after ramping up on it</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ask questions about the project (desired outcomes, day to day)</li>
  <li>Find a way to give your potential areas of growth a positive spin</li>
  <li>Be mindful of your speaking tempo and enunciation</li>
  <li>Pause and breathe before answering questions. Use active-listening</li>
  <li>Ask questions, state assumptions, and walk interviewers through your thought process / game plan before writing a single line of code</li>
  <li>Keep your solutions as simple as possible<ul>
      <li>Get points on the board and then make your solution more elegant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Align your answers with their existing stacks<ul>
      <li>E.g. if they use Snowflake, answer SQL questions using Snowflake SQL</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Break down a problem into manageable increments. Iterative and conversational approach</li>
  <li>Write readable, production-level code</li>
  <li>If there's a whiteboard, USE IT</li>
  <li>Document questions + answer keys of your screen <strong>immediately after</strong> (while it’s fresh!) to support colleagues in future mtg preps<ul>
      <li>Under the /Clients folder on our google drive</li>
      <li>Create an interviews folder if it doesn’t exist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>When starting a project</h2>
