  - It covers the course, but also has material at the end on content that wasn't necessarily in the course, but was on the exam.
- Lots of questions around well-architected framework on the exam. (e.g. What are the pillars? Which pillar does __ fall into?)
- Deepest parts of the exam is around roles and users. Other stuff tends to be more surface level.
