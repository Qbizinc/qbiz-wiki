<h2 class="toc-header" id="background"> Background</h2>
<p>The AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty certification is intended for individuals who perform a development or data science role. It validates a candidate's ability to design, implement, deploy, and maintain machine learning (ML) solutions for given business problems.</p>

<h2 class="toc-header" id="aws-machine-learning-stack"> AWS Machine Learning Stack</h2>
<p><img alt="aws_ml_stack.png" src="/images/aws_ml_certification/aws_ml_stack.png"><br>
The AWS ML stack is made up of three key layers of abstraction.  When building a machine learning solution, key priorities to balance may consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>speed to market</li>
<li>level of customization</li>
<li>machine learning skill level</li>
</ul>
<p>At the top layer, you have AI Services, which are “fully managed services for quickly adding machine learning capabilities to workloads using API calls”; ML knowledge is not required to utilize these.</p>
<p>The middle layer, ML Services, is primarily made up of SageMaker related tools.  SageMaker spans the machine learning pipeline by offering solutions for labeling data as well as building, training and deploying machine learning models while largely abstracting away infrastructure maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The bottom layer, ML Frameworks + Infrastructure, contains the “closest to the metal” solutions, allowing machine learning practitioners to build machine learning solutions from the ground up.  With deep learning containers and images, AWS supports many common machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Apache MXNet.</p>

<p>the tradeoffs/capabilities between different ingestion solutions</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> DMS is specific to migration and legacy systems. Glue is generally best when you don't want to do much work, while step functions are good for flexibility and queing. For streaming, data Kafka is more work, but offers porting code. Kinesis is easy.</p>
<p><em>Tip: Much of this exam is finding the optimal solution and not just the right one for the specific business problem (simplest to implement, offer flexibility to port codebase, etc.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Batch Processing</strong><br>
With batch processing, the ingestion layer periodically collects and groups source data and sends it to a destination like Amazon S3. You can process groups based on any logical ordering, the activation of certain conditions, or a simple schedule. Batch processing is typically used when there is no real need for real-time or near-real-time data, because it is generally easier and more affordably implemented than other ingestion options.</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Glue</li>
<li>AWS DMS</li>
<li>AWS Step Functions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stream Processing</strong><br>
Stream processing, which includes real-time processing, involves no grouping at all. Data is sourced, manipulated, and loaded as soon as it is created or recognized by the data ingestion layer. This kind of ingestion is less cost-effective, since it requires systems to constantly monitor sources and accept new information. But you might want to use it for real-time predictions using an Amazon SageMaker endpoint that you want to show your customers on your website or some real-time analytics that require continually refreshed data, like real-time dashboards</p>

<h3 class="toc-header" id="h-13-identify-and-implement-a-data-transformation-solution"> 1.3 Identify and implement a data-transformation solution</h3>
<p>The raw data ingested into a service like Amazon S3 is usually not ML ready as is. The data needs to be transformed and cleaned, which includes deduplication, incomplete data management, and attribute standardization. Data transformation can also involve changing the data structures, if necessary, usually into an OLAP model to facilitate easy querying of data.</p>
<p>Data transformation is often necessary to deal with huge amounts of data. Distributed computation frameworks like MapReduce and Apache Spark provide a protocol of data processing and node task distribution and management. They also use algorithms to split datasets into subsets and distribute them across nodes in a compute cluster.</p>
<p>Using Apache Spark on Amazon EMR provides a managed framework that can process massive quantities of data. Amazon EMR supports many instance types that have proportionally high CPU with increased network performance, which is well suited for HPC (high-performance computing) applications.</p>
<p>In the case of streaming data, Kinesis Firehose can transform data before storage using AWS Lambda.</p>
