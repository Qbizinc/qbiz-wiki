# AWS ML Specialty

## Background
The AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty certification is intended for individuals who perform a development or data science role. It validates a candidate's ability to design, implement, deploy, and maintain machine learning (ML) solutions for given business problems.

### Exam Outline
The exam is 65 questions in length which must be answered within 190 minutes.  Scores are provided on a scale from 100, 1000, with 750 the minimum passing score.  The exam is available for taking remotely, but proctoring is required and provided.  There are no breaks (so manage your liquids!), and no resources can be used, online or otherwise, during the exam.  

There are two question types on the exam, multiple choice, and multiple response.  For multiple response questions, the number of responses expected is provided  (i.e., select 2 of 5 choices).  

The exam is organized into four key topics, with several objectives under each topic, as outlined below.  

**Domain 1: Data Engineering (20%)**
1.1 Create data repositories for machine learning.
1.2 Identify and implement a data-ingestion solution.
1.3 Identify and implement a data-transformation solution.

**Domain 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (24%)**
2.1 Sanitize and prepare data for modeling.
2.2 Perform feature engineering.
2.3 Analyze and visualize data for machine learning.

**Domain 3: Modeling (36%)**
3.1 Frame business problems as machine learning problems.
3.2 Select the appropriate model(s) for a given machine learning problem.
3.3 Train machine learning models.
3.4 Perform hyperparameter optimization.
3.5 Evaluate machine learning models.

**Domain 4: Machine Learning Implementation and Operations (20%)**
4.1 Build machine learning solutions for performance, availability, scalability, resiliency, and fault tolerance.
4.2 Recommend and implement the appropriate machine learning services and features for a given problem.
4.3 Apply basic AWS security practices to machine learning solutions.
4.4 Deploy and operationalize machine learning solutions.
