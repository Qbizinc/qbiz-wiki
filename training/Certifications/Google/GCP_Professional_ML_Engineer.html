<h1>GCP Professional Machine Learning Engineer</h1>
<p>With QBiz, we're using GCP partner portal to access all the GCP trainings. To be able to register to <strong>Certification Learning Path: Professional Machine Learning Engineer </strong>you need to follow<strong> </strong>the path:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ask Mayra Madrigal to send you GCP partner portal link.</li>
  <li>You'll receive an email with the title <strong>Welcome to Google Cloud Partner Advantage! </strong>Follow the “Login to the portal” link in the email, and login with your QBiz credentials.</li>
  <li>Under the tab “Training” you can see a list of Google Cloud certifications portfolio trainings, one of them being <strong>Professional Machine Learning Engineer. </strong>At least for me, the access was denied for all the certification trainings at this point.</li>
  <li>To get access to Machine Learning training, you need to follow the instructions in<a href="https://qbiz-wiki.com/en/training/Certifications/Google/Kickstart"> https://qbiz-wiki.com/en/training/Certifications/Google/Kickstart</a> . You'll notice there is no option for Machine Leaning in the Partner Certification Kickstart tab, so you can register for Professional Data Engineer training. Goes against intuition, but it worked for me, but following this process, I got access to the Machine Learning path.</li>
</ol>
