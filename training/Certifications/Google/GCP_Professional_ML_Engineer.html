<h1>GCP Professional Machine Learning Engineer</h1>
<p>With QBiz, we're using GCP partner portal to access all the GCP trainings. To be able to register to <strong>Certification Learning Path: Professional Machine Learning Engineer </strong>you need to follow<strong> </strong>the path:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ask Mayra Madrigal to send you GCP partner portal link.</li>
  <li>You'll receive an email with the title <strong>Welcome to Google Cloud Partner Advantage! </strong>Follow the “Login to the portal” link in the email, and login with your QBiz credentials.</li>
  <li>Under the tab “Training” you can see a list of Google Cloud certifications portfolio trainings, one of them being <strong>Professional Machine Learning Engineer. </strong>At least for me, the access was denied for all the certification trainings at this point.</li>
  <li>To get access to Machine Learning training, you need to follow the instructions in<a href="https://qbiz-wiki.com/en/training/Certifications/Google/Kickstart"> https://qbiz-wiki.com/en/training/Certifications/Google/Kickstart</a> . You'll notice there is no option for Machine Leaning in the Partner Certification Kickstart tab, so you can register for Professional Data Engineer training. It goes against intuition, but following this process, the Machine Learning trainings became accessible.</li>

<h2>Issues with Labs</h2>
<p>This section lists issues encountered in the Qwiklab labs in the course and provides solutions or workarounds where possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Introduction to Vertex Pipelines</h3>
<p>Problem:<br>One of the pipeline containers fails with the error <code>TypeError: emojize() got an unexpected keyword argument 'use_aliases' </code>.</p>
<p>Solution:<br>Simply remove the <code>use_aliases</code> parameter from the <code>emojize()</code> function call in the emoji component.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Structured data prediction using Vertex AI Platform</h3>
<p>It isn't that much of a problem, since the prompts are there in the notebook, but this lab uses the old AI Platform rather than Vertex AI in places (despite the title), so you need to enable the AI Platform API (ml.googleapis.com) as well as the standard Vertex AI APIs, and then the model &amp; jobs are listed in the AI Platform web UI rather than the conventional Vertex AI location. E.g. https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/jobs</p>
