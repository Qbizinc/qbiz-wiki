# Kickstart
The Goole Partner Kickstart program is designed to bootstrap getting started on your GCP Certification, for free.  After completeing the series of training modules, you will be eligable for a voucher for the cost of the exam.  

1. First, you must have access to the [Partner Advantage](https://www.partneradvantage.goog/GCPPRM/s/) portal.  Ask and admin (currently Jeff and Mayra) to add your QBiz e-mail address to the ... list. You will get an email with the subject "Welcome to Google Cloud Partner Advantage!" immediately to confirm your account has been added.

2. Once you have access, you'll be asked to setup a profile as part of your first visit.

3. Register for the Kickstart Program from the [Credentials and certifications](https://www.partneradvantage.goog/GCPPRM/s/trainingcredentials) page.  Have a specific certification in mind before registering for Kickstart -- a list of certifications can be found on this page. However, if you want to do the Machine Learning certificate training, you'll notice it's not available under Kickstart. However, you can choose another training (for example Data Engineering). After registering, you'll receive an e-mail from _Google Cloud Partner Training_ with an outline of the weekly exercises (6 weeks for Data Engineers). You'll have the Machine Learning training links available after receiving the link, even though they are not explicitely mentioned.  ***NOTE: completion deadline is within 10 weeks of enrollment in order to get the free voucher*** 
![kickstart_enroll.png](/kickstart_enroll.png) A series of 2 emails will confirm enrollment in the kickstart course: 
- Immediatly you will get an email with the subject line: "Youâ€™re 	enrolled! Welcome to Partner Certification Kickstart"
- Within 24 hours, you will get another email with the subject line: "Here are your Google Cloud learning resources". If you do not get this second email within 24 hours, there was an error provisioning your account and you will run into issues down the road. To correct this you can reach out to qwicklabs support: support@qwiklab.zendesk.com


4. After complete all the courses, send an e-mail to *partnersupport@qwiklab.zendesk.com* and ask for your voucher.  Fulfilment can take a couple of days.
