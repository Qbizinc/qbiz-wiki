# What

Qram is a repository for learning for Qbiz.

## Scope
Currently:
- Technical topics
- Delivery

# When
Qram is a collection of ***nibbles***, which are discrete pieces of content which may be consumed in 15 to 20 minutes.

***Nibbles*** are organized into larger structures taking greater amounts of time and focus. These larger structures form a layer of opinionated, curated, sequencing of ***nibbles*** to cover larger topics. These larger structures are named using an analogy of dining:

1. ***[Nibbles](/training/qram/nibbles)***: 15 to 20 minutes
2. ***[Dishes](/training/qram/dishes)***: 1 hour
3. ***[Meals](/training/qram/meals) ***: 2 to 3 hours
4. ***Menu***: 8 to 10 hours
5. ***Meal Plan***: 30 to 40 hours

Higher level structures may reuse lower level structures.

***Nibbles*** are intended to be reusable. For example, a ***nibble*** for performance optimization may be used in a data science ***dish*** as well as a data engineering ***dish***.

Qram content is non-hierarchical. Instead, it forms a knowledge graph.

# How

## Production
The production workflow for Qram content is under development. For now, please place all new content under the [`/raw/` subdirectory](/training/qram/raw/).

Writing unfinished, crappy stuff down is more important than jumping directly to publication-worthy artifacts!
