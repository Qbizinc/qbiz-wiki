# What

Qram is a repository for learning for Qbiz.

## Scope
Currently:
- Technical topics
- Delivery

## Structure

Qram is a collection of ***nibbles***, which are discrete pieces of content which may be consumed in 15 to 20 minutes.

***Nibbles*** are organized into larger structures taking greater amounts of time and focus. These larger structures form a layer of opinionated, curated, sequencing of ***nibbles*** to cover larger topics. These larger structures are named using an analogy of dining:

1. ***[Nibbles](/training/qram/nibbles/)***: 15 to 20 minutes
2. ***[Dishes](/training/qram/dishes/)***: 1 hour
3. ***Meals***: 2 to 3 hours
4. ***Menu***: 1 to 2 days
5. ***Meal Plan***: 1 week

Higher level structures may reuse lower level structures.

***Nibbles*** are intended to be reusable. For example, a ***nibble*** for performance optimization may be used in a data science ***dish*** as well as a data engineering ***dish***.

Qram content is non-hierarchical. Instead, it forms a knowledge graph.

## Production

The production workflow for Qram content is under development. For now, please place all new content under the [`/raw/` subdirectory](/training/qram/raw/).

An editor will review to create the appropriate published Qram content.
