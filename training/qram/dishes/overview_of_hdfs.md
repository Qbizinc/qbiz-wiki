# What
Hadoop Distributed File System is the file system underlying Hadoop installations.

In addition to understanding Hadoop itself, the Hadoop architecture is influential on other distributed separate-storage-and-compute architectures.

# Path
1. Begin with a high-level understanding of file systems:
   1. [Definition of File System (Nibble)](/training/qram/nibbles/definition_of_file_system)
2. Next, gain a high-level understanding of distributed file systems:
   1. Understanding the objectives of DFSs in general help to understand Hadoop.
   2. [Definition of Distributed File System (Nibble)](/training/qram/nibbles/definition_of_distributed_file_system)
   3. Note that most DFS designs are peer-to-peer.
3. Finally, introduce yourself to HDFS:
   1. [Definition of HDFS (Nibble)](/training/qram/nibbles/definition_of_hdfs)
   2. Note that HDFS does not support versioning.
