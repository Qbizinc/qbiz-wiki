# What
Data Management is a core aspect of an organization’s ability to manage its data and information assets. The term “metadata” describes the various facets of an information asset that can improve its usability throughout its life cycle.

Metadata and its uses go far beyond technical matters. Metadata is used as a reference for business-oriented and technical projects, and lays the foundations for describing, inventorying and understanding data for multiple use cases. Use-case examples include data governance, security and risk, data analysis and data value.

## Context
As companies increasingly recognize the role data can play in their evolution, the number of roles requiring more timely, accurate access to data intelligence increases. The convergence of exploding data production, scalable big data computation, and advanced analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence have given rise to citizen analysts: business-oriented problem-solvers charged with understanding how to apply analytical techniques to massive data sets to identify emergent business opportunities.

Additionally, the prevalence of chief data officers (CDOs) continues to grow to better harmonize data management, governance and consumption efforts to overcome the opaqueness, complexity and siloed nature of enterprise data. Enterprises today must have visibility of their data (and metadata) landscape to harvest, curate and publish data assets available for analysis and reporting. Plus both IT and citizen analysts need access with an understanding of how different data assets can be used along with guidelines for adhering to data policies that best protect the organization.

## Components
- **Data Catalog/Dictionary:** Capture data definitions, business glossaries, data dictionaries, and other metadata required to support the business activities
- **Automated Data Lineage:** Ability to track a particular data element or set of data elements across various systems of record
- **Data Models:** Connect physical metadata to specific data models, business terms, definitions and reusable design standards.
- **Data Quality:** Implement proactive management of data quality for business critical data across the information supply chain
- **Data Classification:** Data classification is broadly defined as the process of organizing data by relevant categories so that it may be used and protected more efficiently
- **Data Profiling:** Implement data forensics (profiling), issue management and root-cause analysis capability for data quality issues
- **Master Data Management(MDM):** Develop single versions of the truth for key business entities such as customers, accounts, products, suppliers, etc.
- **Reference Data Management:** Data used to classify or categorize other data. Typically, they are static or slowly changing over time. Examples of reference data include: Units of measurement. Country codes.
- **Data Controls:** Deploy a data quality framework for consistently defining data quality requirements
- **Governance Workflow:** Implement processes, policies, procedures and standards to govern business critical data.  Data Governance is a centralized control mechanism to manage data availability, security, usability, and integrity.
- **Data Collaboration:** Empower stakeholders to see data in one place and in the context of their roles.
- **Certification/Scoring:** Develop data certification processes and associated business solutions to certify the quality of internally generated and externally sourced data with associated evidence (transaction logs, workflow process, audit trail etc.)
