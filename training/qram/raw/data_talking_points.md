Based on roundup of:
- Gartner, Forrester, G2 choice of how to categorize products
- Fortune, Forbes, Inc.com, CIO concentrations of talking points

# Summary
- There seem to be three lenses on the entire data space:
  - BI, which lumps in dashboarding
  - AI/ML
  - Supporting operations (governance down to infrastructure)

The purchasing audience is treated as distinct for each, so all of the industry talk treats them as separate, even though they all share 80% of the same infrastructure and relevant processes/tooling.

> The challenge is a set of talking points that allows Qbiz to pivot between these three contexts seamlessly to sell the large transformation projects. Also, when some C-level shows up asking for wholesale transformation, talking to the other stakeholders in those three distinct contexts without giving them context that yanks them out of their charter.

# BI vs. AI/ML vs. Admin/DataOps

## BI
Talking points center around:
- Data driven decision making
- Actionable insights
- Understanding why metrics are out- or under-performing

> G2 has the most succinct roundup of these that I have found: https://www.g2.com/categories/business-intelligence
> -- Jenny Kwan

These are all the same thing:
- When facing a decision I know I face, do I have the right data to make that decision?
- I want the data platform to tell me that decisions are even available to be made (i.e. are there decisions I don't know that I could be making?).
- The data platform and supporting processes/tooling should run continuously to monitor for these opportunities.
- Implicit in "do I have the data to make that decision" is the ability to research to identify a point of intervention, i.e. blame.

> The infographic embedded in this Inc.com article from 2014 (stale) is still a pretty good set of talking points. (The graphic is from the CIS department at Metropolitan College at Boston University.) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1esWFZpKeq5jtfknU5FpFQf5vnG85AQh-/view?usp=sharing

### Stakeholders
- Board, C-level
  - Dashboards with KPIs.
    > Everyone wants to feel like a fighter pilot.
    > -- Jenny Kwan
- Functional leaders, i.e. head of marketing, sales, etc.
  - Same dashboards C-levels are holding them accountable to, of course.
    - Opportunity here is selling that the functional leader gets to define how they are measured.
  - Alerting and monitoring for points of management intervention
    - Stale leads/cases/tickets
    - Risk monitoring
      > Best practice is in conjunction with the actual IC doing the task so the IC isn't surprised when the manager swoops in. Oy, when the culture doesn't support this...
      > -- Jenny Kwan

#### Operations and Operational Platforms
i.e. Salesforce, any point-of-sale, etc.

> - I have never seen BI/dashboard rollouts geared towards operational IC staff to ever work in practice. In order for these not to be a PITA, the information has to be integrated into the operational platform so the IC isn't tab switching to get all of the information necessary to do their job.
> - NB: Expecting an IC to do this is adoption graveyard. They either hold info in their heads as they tab switch or have to write things down on paper? Come on!
> - NB: this is data! But no one who talks data includes integration with operational platforms, at least in press. Operational platforms control their own points of integration, so the product vendors take this over and then offer shitty, siloed data, and it's in their interest to pull every competing operational platform's data into their own proprietary operational platform.
> - NBB: Don't get me started on Salesforce / Force.com.

Helping clients see that centralizing their data into a single operational platform means losing total control:
- At the very least, the client takes on the product vendor's KPI definitions.
- Their dashboards work for ICs and tactical team leads, but the higher up you go, the less they fit.
- Their dashboards never work outside their function. A CRM platform's dashboard will never offer good integration with supply chain data.
- Later, even if they want to switch out their non-data operational workflows (redefine roles, teams, processes), the fact of data gravity means they're extra locked in.

## AI/ML
Two distinct sets of talking points emerge in press, often from the same people a few months apart (weird):
- AI/ML is now!
  > Impulse buy!
  > -- Jenny Kwan
- AI/ML isn't ready but prepare for it now b/c when the pistol fires...

Product vendors sort into the two based on what they sell:
- DS platforms and other tools: now!
- Centralized data management, especially governance: prepare!

Industry analysts are inconsistent. (It doesn't help that many of the articles are paid for by product vendors, and competitors go to the same analyst firms.)

A challenge for Qbiz is a coherent set of talking points that helps clients integrate the conflicting press.

### AI/ML is now!

### Prepare for AI/ML!
