Based on roundup of:
- Gartner, Forrester, G2 choice of how to categorize products
- Fortune, Forbes, Inc.com, CIO concentrations of talking points

# Summary
- There seem to be three lenses on the entire data space:
  - BI, which lumps in dashboarding
  - AI/ML
  - Supporting operations (governance down to infrastructure)

The purchasing audience is treated as distinct for each, so all of the industry talk treats them as separate, even though they all share 80% of the same infrastructure and relevant processes/tooling.

# BI vs. AI/ML vs. Admin/DataOps

## BI
Talking points center around:
- Data driven decision making
- Actionable insights
- Understanding why metrics are out- or under-performing

These are all the same thing:
- When facing a decision I know I face, do I have the right data to make that decision?
- I want the data platform to tell me that decisions are even available to be made (i.e. are there decisions I don't know that I could be making?).
- The data platform and supporting processes/tooling should run continuously to monitor for these opportunities.
- Implicit in "do I have the data to make that decision" is the ability to research to identify a point of intervention, i.e. blame.

> The infographic embedded in this Inc.com article from 2014 (stale) is still a pretty good set of talking points. (The graphic is from the CIS department at Metropolitan College at Boston University.) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1esWFZpKeq5jtfknU5FpFQf5vnG85AQh-/view?usp=sharing

### Stakeholders
- Board, C-level
- Functional leaders, i.e. head of marketing, sales, etc.: these tend to be more tactical based
