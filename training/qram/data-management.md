## What
**Data Management:** Metadata management is a cross-organizational agreement on how to define informational assets for converting data into an enterprise asset. As data volumes and diversity grow, metadata management is even more critical to derive business value from the gigantic amounts of data.

### Description:
Data Management is a core aspect of an organization’s ability to manage its data and information assets. The term “metadata” describes the various facets of an information asset that can improve its usability throughout its life cycle.

Metadata and its uses go far beyond technical matters. Metadata is used as a reference for business-oriented and technical projects, and lays the foundations for describing, inventorying and understanding data for multiple use cases. Use-case examples include data governance, security and risk, data analysis and data value.

## Format What
As companies increasingly recognize the role data can play in their evolution, the number of roles requiring more timely, accurate access to data intelligence increases. The convergence of exploding data production, scalable big data computation, and advanced analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence have given rise to citizen analysts: business-oriented problem-solvers charged with understanding how to apply analytical techniques to massive data sets to identify emergent business opportunities.

Additionally, the prevalence of chief data officers (CDOs) continues to grow to better harmonize data management, governance and consumption efforts to overcome the opaqueness, complexity and siloed nature of enterprise data. Enterprises today must have visibility of their data (and metadata) landscape to harvest, curate and publish data assets available for analysis and reporting. Plus both IT and citizen analysts need access with an understanding of how different data assets can be used along with guidelines for adhering to data policies that best protect the organization.
