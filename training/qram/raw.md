# What
Drafts and other raw materials.

Let this be the 80% of the lake that is unfinished and rarely accessed. Recording knowledge in a messy way is more important than jumping directly to a publication-worthy artifact.

# How
1. Put stuff under this directory.
2. Ping **@here** in the **#qbiz_training** Slack channel.
3. **TBD:** a prioritized publication process.
