<h2>Requirement Gathering Process</h2>
<p>The purpose of this guide is to provide a structured process for gathering requirements on client engagements, particularly those that involve selecting and implementing a new technology or cloud solution.</p>
<p>Overall, our goal in this process is to capture the problems that we are being asked to solve, both from a technical standpoint and from a broader business value perspective. We will need to show clients that we are considering their current needs and the existing constraints as well as the advantages and drawbacks of any potential solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><br><strong>Business/functional and technical requirements for solution</strong></h3>
<p>We should seek to answer the following questions in this process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why is the customer in need of a cloud solution (or whatever tool is being considered)?<ul>
      <li>This question should focus primarily on the technical need, from the perspective of those who are most impacted by the existing problem. Typically, this will be a data science or analytics team or the data engineering team.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>IT and engineering challenges can also be discussed here, but it is important not to lose focus on the larger problem that we are being asked to solve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What business problem is data analytics solving and/or what solution is it providing?<ul>
      <li>This is an elaboration on the answers to the previous question, but should take more of a business focus. Ideally, this information will be used to justify the expenses/changes to client leadership/decision makers.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Here would be a great place to focus on the cost of existing problems (i.e., our team has spent 200 hours this month chasing down data discrepancies) or the value that can be provided by our proposed solution (i.e. reduce platform downtime, automate tedious/time-consuming tasks, etc.). We should also highlight any monetary costs that can be saved compared to existing architecture.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are the pros/cons of our current stack?<ul>
      <li>Although the current stack likely has some major issues that are covered above, it's important to get a full accounting of what users like/dislike about the tool, as well as any unique features. There may be some “must have” features that will be difficult to replicate, or that some users have become quite attached to.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are the pros/cons of each alternative solution?<ul>
      <li>Here is where we follow a similar process to the above and highlight the strengths and drawbacks of each candidate solution. We should be sure to spell out the specific features that could solve the problems we have highlighted above, as well as any features that can directly provide business value.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>We should also note any potential drawbacks that will be introduced by a new product, particularly around features that exist in the legacy solution but do not exist in the candidate solution.</li>
      <li>We should do our best to specifically answer these questions:<ul>
          <li>Does this solution save costs?</li>
          <li>How does this solution add value to the business?&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What criteria should we use to evaluate and compare our alternatives?<ul>
      <li>The slideshow below contains several examples, but be sure to include any additional criteria that might be necessary, as well as any tests that will need to be performed.</li>
      <li>Key criteria such as security, cost, and compatibility with existing infrastructure should be highlighted, as these will be of most interest to executives.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation and Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Here is an example <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W28ByYzS3bjtBzHfxIHd9uHKOdMmqqm9rz-Qxc4fG14/edit#slide=id.p1">slide deck</a> that can be used to present candidate solutions to clients. It also includes a starter list of evaluation criteria, but that list should be expanded upon with client input.</li>
  <li>Make sure to grab client documentation through the process! Specifically, we should ensure QBiz has meeting minutes, workshop presentations (like the slide deck above) and any email correspondence discussing the various alternatives.</li>
  <li>One easy way to build client trust and buy-in is through including many key players in this evaluation process. This will ensure that all needs are met, help reduce surprise issues later (i.e. new tool cannot connect with critical infrastructure), and make clients feel like their opinion is valued.</li>
  <li>Part of this process should include laying out a clear project timeline - we should assume it will take at least 2-3 weeks to gather all requirements and conduct evaluations. This should also make clear which tasks will require client input/sign-off, so they understand when they will be needed to act.</li>
</ul>
