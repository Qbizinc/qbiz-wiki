# AI Releases
### August
[Introducing SafeCoder](https://huggingface.co/blog/safecoder)
- SafeCoder is not a model, but a complete end-to-end commercial solution
- SafeCoder is built with security and privacy as core principles - code never leaves the VPC during training or inference
- SafeCoder is designed for self-hosting by the customer on their own infrastructure
- SafeCoder is designed for customers to own their own Code Large Language Model


[Model Memory Calculator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-accelerate/model-memory-usage)
🤗 **Model Memory Calculator**
HuggingFace just released a tool will help you calculate how much vRAM is needed to train and perform big model inference on a model hosted on the 🤗 Hugging Face Hub. The minimum recommended vRAM needed for a model is denoted as the size of the “largest layer”, and training of a model is roughly 4x its size (for Adam).

These calculations are accurate within a few percent at most, such as bert-base-cased being 413.68 MB and the calculator estimating 413.18 MB.
