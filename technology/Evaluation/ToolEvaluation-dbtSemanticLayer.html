<h1>Tool Evaluation - dbt Semantic Layer</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Informal Working Notes</h2>
<p>The dbt Semantic Layer is composed of open source components in the core product and proprietary components which are part of the dbt Cloud hosted service.</p>

<p>Good discussion about using metrics in dbt:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/how-to-design-and-structure-metrics</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presentation from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nM0kp0EMdE&amp;list=PL0QYlrC86xQlj9UDGiEwhXQuSjuSyPJHl">Coalesce 2022 Hands-on: the dbt Semantic Layer</a> – it's pretty high level and not very hands-on. The slides are <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lOH6Sb8DQnnlmZkYOlqqHgQeXKkUEQCm_LOxsjBRJlM/edit#slide=id.g15e5f35d9d3_0_470">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metrics can only be calculated on materialized transforms. I.e. dbt has created a table or view in the DWH.</p>
<p>It is currently in Public Preview, supporting only Snowflake. A Team account is required for Metadata API access.</p>
<p>Roadmap for the “Semantic Layer” in dbt Core is to build out the features of the metrics with things like versioning and improved developer experience; and to add Entities to Metrics. Entities will allow joining on dimensions etc.</p>
<p>Roadmap for the Semantic Layer in dbt Cloud primarily about increasing performance and availability and the number of supported data warehouses.</p>
<p>Data caching is not part of the dbt Semantic Layer product or current roadmap. No current integration with LookML and there is overlap.</p>
