<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Datahub is a connection of Docker containers, launched with Docker-Compose, and managed by a (kludgy) CLI. &nbsp;The CLI is written in Python and can be reviewed &nbsp;to makeup for missing details in the documentation. &nbsp;Essentially, the CLI is a wrapper around the <i>docker-compose</i> and <i>docker pull</i> commands. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datahub.com/docs/quickstart">Datahub Quickstart Guide</a> is the only Installation document and anything with <i>Quickstart</i> in the name isn't going to go into much detail. &nbsp;The username and password are both <i>datahub</i> so you will want to change this pretty quickly if running exposed to the internet – such as our sandbox instance in AWS.</p>
<h3>HTTPS</h3>
<p>The webserver does support HTTPS, but you will need to set a variable in the configuration file to enable it and restart the container. &nbsp;However, this doesn't include a Certificate Authority. &nbsp;For Certificate Authority support, you have the following options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> client on the server and modify the Docker Compose file to mount the location were the certificates will be stored – and updated.</li>
  <li>Install a Reverse Proxy to handle the SSL communication and forward it to the datahub port.</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose both, but the settled on the second option and <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> as the reverse proxy. &nbsp;Caddy has a Let's Encrypt client installed by default and will handle the certificate updates; all you need to do is pass it the correct &nbsp;configuration file.</p>
<h4>Caddy</h4>
<p>Caddyfile (configuration)</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">datahub.qbiz-wiki.com {
        # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
        reverse_proxy http://datahub.qbiz-wiki.com:9002
} </code></pre>
<p>To launch a Docker Container so that Caddyfile can be seen in the container, use the following command:<br><code>docker run -d --rm -it -p 443:443 -p80:80 -v $PWD/conf:/etc/caddy -v caddy_data:/data caddy</code></p>
