# Tools We Should Consider Licensing

There are a number of tools that we should consider having licensed versions of for Qbiz.  This page is a convenient place to store that list, and the justifications for each tool.  Longer content for specific tools may have independent pages.

| Tool | Justification(s) | 
|------|------------------|
| Slack | See [this page](/technology/slack/the-case-for-paying) |
| Last Pass Enterprise | To demonstrate to clients we have a story about how we manage credentials to their systems |
| Pycharm | We do a lot of python development |
| Reclaim.ai | Currently free (thru Mar 2022) as they are a startup; will cost money then |
| Lucidchart | Database diagrams - set a standard of excellence for our clients (Qbiz templates) |
| JIRA | As we transition to more project based work, it may be necessary to have our own internal project tracking for when our customers don't have their own |
