# Tools We Should Consider Licensing

There are a number of tools that we should consider having licensed versions of for Qbiz.  This page is a convenient place to store that list, and the justifications for each tool.  Longer content for specific tools may have independent pages.  Tools that fill similar usages are grouped together in an appropriate category.


### Communication Tools

| Tool  | Justification(s) | 
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Slack | See [this page](/technology/slack/the-case-for-paying) |

### Security Tools

| Tool | Justification(s) | 
|------|------------------|
| Last Pass Enterprise | To demonstrate to clients we have a story about how we manage credentials to their systems |

### Development Tools

| Tool |  Justification(s) | 
|------|------------------|
| Pycharm  | We do a lot of python development |
| Microsoft VSCode | Microsoft VSCode as possible substitute for PyCharm (keeping in mind that one of the best features of PyCharm IMO is its SQL client -- not sure if there's a VSCode plugin that's roughly equivalent) |

### Diagraming Tools
| Tool  | Justification(s) | 
|-------|------------------|
| Lucidchart | set a standard of excellence for our clients (Qbiz templates) |
| diagrams.net | Is diagrams.net (formerly draw.io) a suitable option for diagrams? It's (currently) free and does a pretty good job. |

### Project Management Tools
| Tool | Justification(s) | 
|------|------------------|
| JIRA | As we transition to more project based work, it may be necessary to have our own internal project tracking for when our customers don't have their own.  One potential downside may be maintenance overhead if we host it ourselves. |

### Other Business Tools
| Tool | Category | Justification(s) | 
|------|----------|------------------|
| Reclaim.ai | Calendar coordination | Currently free (thru Mar 2022) as they are a startup; will cost money then |
