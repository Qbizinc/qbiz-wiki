# Slack
### Current State
As of 2021-10-22, Qbiz currently uses the free version of Slack,  and there are a number of features not available to us with this version, this page is intended to capture the various features and use cases to justify the increased expense.

### Slack Features

##### Access to history 
  - The free version of slack limits us to ~2 months of content (which acutally will be less, the more we use it since it's capped based upon ~10K messages)

##### Unlimited number of apps 
  - Slack has a wide ecosystem of applications that are supported, but the free plan severly limits the number of apps that can be integrated.  (See the next section for more specifics on apps)

##### Automated messages 
  - When we had a free trial of slack, Rob set up a welcome message which posted for each person who joined "general" a short guide of what channels were available and what they were used for.  When the trial expired, so did the welcome message, which now gets occassionaly posted to general.
  - We could also have automated reminder messages for things like submitting expense reports and time sheets at the end of each month

##### Slack Connect
  - Slack Connect allows us to interact with our customers (many of whom use slack themselves) directly through Slack.  Imagine having a Qbiz-Lyft channel or Qbiz-Komodo channel where we could easily reach out to our contacts at those companies via slack rather than email.

##### Screen sharing while calling via Slack
  - Slack calls don't support screen sharing unless you have a paid version.

##### Channel Organization
  - The paid version of slack allows for custom groupings of channels.

### Apps We Might Use
This section lists some of the apps which we think might be useful.
##### Google Integrations
  - We already have the app to integrate Google drive and Google Calendar, but there are other Google integrations

##### Polly
  - Polly is an app that allows for quick polls to be conducted in slack, this might be a useful way to collect feedback after a presentation.  See https://qbizinc.slack.com/apps/A04E6JX41-polly
  
##### Standup.ly
  - As an alternative to long status updates in the Wednesday meetings, we could have asynchronous standups with something like Standup.ly.  See https://qbizinc.slack.com/apps/A355V71K7-standuply


### Apps We Might Want To Be Familiar With
There are a number of apps which we might want to be familiar with in terms of recommending their usage to our customers or helping our customers with their implementation.  

##### Looker
  - Looker has an app on the slack. See https://qbizinc.slack.com/apps/AQ1UQTDK6-looker

##### PushMetrics
  - PushMetrics has an app that claims to integrate Tableau dashboards into Slack.  See https://qbizinc.slack.com/apps/A5LB0D1EK-pushmetrics
  
##### Jenkins
  - See https://qbizinc.slack.com/apps/A0F7VRFKN-jenkins-ci

##### JIRA
  - See https://qbizinc.slack.com/apps/A2RPP3NFR-jira-cloud
  - It looks like this might be installed for us already, which is kind of funny, because I don't think we have a JIRA instance.
  - There are a number of other JIRA integrations available
