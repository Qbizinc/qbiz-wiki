## Peope Insights Data Science (David Erickson, 8/2020-6/2021)
While at Facebook I supported 2 product teams as the sole data scientist. I worked with PMs and other stakeholders to set team north star metrics, goals, top line success metrics, and product success metrics. I built dashboards to track these and led analyses to understand drivers of metrics. We improved average HR transaction time 50%, improved consistency of HR systems from 80% to 99%+, improved the sync speed and reliability of HR systems and set an SLA, and drove hiring manager and job seeker adoption of a new product to target levels. I also drove team roadmap planning with data on project reach and impact. I gained deeper understanding of the user base by utilizing engagement and persona data and drove product changes with UXRs and designers. Met with other data scientists regularly to share knowledge and peer review.

- I put together a [KT Doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u9aFGgl85_K_T-WitG7sVGd2CvQEoTqZ/view?usp=sharing).
- I presented at the weekly meeting on [Product Metrics at Facebook](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PwXvtEOQn5FGtlANSsupech8v5PuHnBDekuJBRpXtyE/edit?usp=sharing). 
- [This directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1py_uuy7RcKGO5bUo0seIv_LqK7GUjK6R?usp=sharing) has analyses that I published internally.
