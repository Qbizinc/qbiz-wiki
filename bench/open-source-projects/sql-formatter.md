# Description
With complex scripts, many SQL formatters do crazy spacing/etc. Fix this

# Notes
[GB]: Would be sweet to create our own linter too based on our Qbiz-specific style guides

[BD]: Not sure if folks have checked out [SQLFluff](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/gettingstarted.html), but I find it pretty impressive. Maybe we could focus on developing some plugins or sample configuration files instead of building our own linter/formatter.
