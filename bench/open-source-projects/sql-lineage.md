# Notes
[BD]: Maybe it would be worth building new (or improving existing) integrations for [Open Lineage](https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/about) which is used by Astronomer and (I think) dbt to get some more bang for our buck. Though it would also be cool to have a CLI tool to do this statically.
