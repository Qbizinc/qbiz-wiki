# Notes
[GB]: Some context on this one. I've often worked with companies where the product teams do not have a clear definition of changes that have gone in over time to their web site / app, with supporting screen captures.

Whenever we DO get a set of screens relevant to some funnel, its often obsolete by the time we get it. Having this lineage of changes will help people be able to figure out important changes that might be lost by employee departures (undocumented tribal knowledge)

[realBD] This seems like the design flow for a web/app might be a good place to start rather than the actual implmentations. E.g. designs in Figma.
